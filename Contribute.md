# Contribute to the By-Laws of the [Built Environment Innovation Cooperative](https://beicoop.wordpress.com/)

The Built Environment Innovation Cooperative (BEIC) manages educational and collaborative efforts aimed at built environment related innovations as project repositories (like these By-Laws) on GitHub. 

Open Source projects in repositories managed by BEIC generally follow the "GitHub Guides" content on "Contributing to Open Source on GitHub".
