The [Built Environment Innovation Cooperative (BEIC)](https://beicoop.wordpress.com/) has by-laws that regulate itself as a multi-stakeholder, educaional cooperative.  BEIC’s creation is a response to built environment industry market imperfections induced by the effects of claims litigation.  These effects can result in business relationships of a defensive nature that can discourage close collaboration and innovation.  BEIC encourages close collaboration and fosters development of trust among stakeholders through participation in open source project based learning experiences in built environment project development.  BEIC’s unique, multi-stakeholder, educational type of cooperative supports a broad range of member patrons’ needs in the accomplishment of BEIC's mission:
* Educate built environment professionals for the 21st century.
* Plan & develop viable solutions to built environment requirements.
* Foster demand for members’ products and services.
