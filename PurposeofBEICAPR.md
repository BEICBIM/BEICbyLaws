# 6. The Purpose of BEIC Assets, Property, and Resources.  

Assets, property, or resources of BEIC exist to fulfill the built environment industry-specific social activities, collaborative project based learning events, and associated technical, logistic, and administrative support needs incumbent upon us. These include such things as project based learning sessions, hackathon-charrettes, new-member parties, and appropriate recognition for sustaining members, professional achievements, as well as certain personal and family events of importance such as weddings, births, adoptions, illness and deaths in the immediate family of BEIC members.
